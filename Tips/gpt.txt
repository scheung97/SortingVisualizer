For the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer application, you can create various unit tests and feature tests to ensure its correctness and verify that it functions as intended. Here are some examples of tests you can consider:

Unit Tests for Sorting Algorithms: Create unit tests for each sorting algorithm to verify that they sort the input data correctly. You can create test cases with different input data sets, including edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, a list with duplicate elements, and a large input size.

Unit Tests for Visualization: Write unit tests to validate the visualization aspect of the application. For example, you can create a test case that checks whether the plot is generated correctly, whether the bars are displayed in the correct order, and whether the colors are updated as expected during the sorting process.

Integration Tests: Create integration tests to ensure that the sorting algorithm functions properly within the visualizer. This can involve running the visualizer with different sorting algorithms and verifying that the plot is updated correctly at each step of the sorting process.

User Interaction Tests: Simulate user interactions and test the response of the application. For example, you can simulate button clicks or keyboard events to trigger different sorting algorithms and verify that the visualization updates accordingly.

Performance Tests: Evaluate the performance of the application by measuring the execution time for different input sizes. This can help identify any potential performance bottlenecks or areas for optimization.

Boundary Tests: Test the application with extreme or boundary input cases. For instance, you can provide input data with the maximum allowed size and verify that the application can handle it correctly without crashes or errors.

Error Handling Tests: Validate the error handling capabilities of the application. Test scenarios such as passing invalid input data, unsupported sorting algorithms, or incorrect user inputs, and ensure that appropriate error messages or behavior are displayed.

Cross-Platform Tests: If your application is designed to run on different platforms or operating systems, perform tests on each platform to ensure consistent behavior and compatibility.
