Great, thank you for providing that information!

For a desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python, I would suggest using a library like PyQt or wxPython, which provides a set of tools for creating cross-platform desktop applications with a native look and feel. These libraries also have built-in support for creating charts and graphs, which can be useful for visualizing the sorting process.

Here are the general steps I would take to build the sorting algorithm visualizer:

Set up the GUI: Create a window with buttons and input fields to specify the input data, as well as a space to display the visualization. For example, you could use PyQt to create a main window with a menu bar and toolbar, and add a canvas widget to display the charts.

Implement the sorting algorithm: Write the Python functions for the sorting algorithms you want to visualize. You mentioned that you have already done this, so you can reuse your code here. Make sure that the functions take the input data as an argument and return a sorted list.

Create a chart: Use Matplotlib or another charting library to create a bar chart that displays the input data. Each bar represents a number in the list, and the height of the bar corresponds to the value of the number.

Update the chart: For each step of the sorting algorithm, update the chart to reflect the current state of the data. For example, if you are using the Bubble Sort algorithm, you would iterate through the list and swap adjacent numbers if they are out of order. After each iteration, you would redraw the chart with the new positions of the bars.

Display the final result: Once the sorting algorithm has finished, display the sorted list in the chart.

Add interactivity: To make the visualizer more engaging, you can add features like buttons to start, pause, and reset the sorting process, as well as sliders to adjust the speed of the animation.
